# soundwrap

## About 
soundwrap is a web application that leverages the React library to interact with and display data from Spotify's API. The app aims to enhance user experience by recommending playlists based on the user's mood and preferred music genres.

## Features
**Playlist Reccomendation**: Users can input a genre and discover which of their playlists contains the most songs from that genre.

**Artist Reccomendation**: Users can enter an artist's name to receive recommendations for similar artists that match their tastes.

## Important Note
Currently, soundwrap operates in Spotify's developer mode. This means only users manually added to the Spotify developer dashboard can authenticate with the app. Once Spotify approves the app for public release, all users will be able to explore and enjoy the full range of SoundWrap's features!
